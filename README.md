# Ted-Talks
Designed a Linear Regression model to predict the number of views and comments based on the publishing date and day, languages translated in, etc. The result showed more views when a Ted talk video is published on Weekday rather than on weekend, which was suprising. View and comments are highly correlated as number on comments increases with increase in number on views and vice versa.
